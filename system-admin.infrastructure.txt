User should double-click the right boundary of the column heading to auto-adjust the column width to fit the content. User should ensure the cell is not formatted with a date/time format that makes the value too long to display and if the cell contains a large number, reduce the number of decimal places to make it fit within the column.

I then would enter the default username and password found in the router’s manual (commonly admin for both). I will set up the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password.

I will reconnect all devices to the new Wi-Fi network or via Ethernet cables, and I would verify internet connectivity in all the connected devices.

7.	Windows Server: The computer with Windows 2000 Server installed was used as a file server for a long period of time. You have noticed that the system performance has decreased and the file operation time has increased.

I will then look for indicators such as a high percentage of fragmented files and large numbers of fragmented free space.

After defragmentation, I then would constantly monitor the system performance to see if it improves.
